Chapter 10- Logical Fallacies:
  Logical Falllacy: Invalid link between a premise and a conclusion.
  
    1. Non-Sequitur b/A: The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. i.e, Swiss cheese is healthy for you, because it is yellow-
          No logical link b/t the premise and the conclusion. 
          
     2. Argument from authority: If Professor A believes X, Professor X speaks from authority, ergo X is true.
      
      3. Argument from Final Outcome: Something is caused by the ultimate effect that it has or the purpose that it serves. i.e, Christian 
      creationists contend that evolution must be true, because if it were true, it would result in immortality.
      
      4. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc: Presuming cause and effect for two events, because they are related.I was ill, I took treatment A, I recovered, 
      treatment A caused me to recover.
       
       5. Correlation and Causation: Atrributing a casual relationship to a correlation.
       
       6. Special Pleading, or Ad Hoc Reasoning: Introducing new elements into the contention, in order to for the contention to appear more valid.
       
       7. Tu Quoque: An attempt to justify a wrong action because someone else does the same thing.
       
       8. Ad Hominem: Countering one's claims by attacking the person rather than addressing the claims itself.
