Chapter 2 - All About Strings

Strings: Can be created with single quotes '', double quotes(""), or triple quotes, for multi-line files(''' ''')
  Type: Immutable types.
  Reassigning a string: Any time a string in python is reassiged its identity changes.
  
  Containts: Only ASCII Characters, if want to use Unicode characters, must be preceded by a u.

Casting: Transforming one type into another type(E.g, x = str(1))

String Formatting: %s, to format strings (E.g, 'I Lke %s' % (NY))
%i (E.G, ('%i + %i = %i' % (1,2,3)

%f - Format floats (E.G, ('%.4f and %.4f) % (.23, .23333).

Templates: ('%(lang)s is equivalent to' {'lang','david'})

('%(lang)s and %(lang)s and %(lang)s and %(lang)s' % {'lang':'david'}
  //Returns david and david and david and david
  
 Chapter 3 - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries:
  
  Lists: Create a Lists with (my_list = list(), my_list = []), including a mixutre of objects.
  
  Nested Lits: Nested lists are lists within lists (E.g, mylist = [['a']['b']
  
  Extend Method: The extend method consolidates two lists together. (E.g, list2.extend(list3))
    list2 += list3
    
   Sort: The sort() method of a list 
   
   Tuples: 
   my_tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   abc = tuple([1, ,2, 3, ,4, 5])
   
 Chapter 4- Conditional Statements:
 
 New Line Character \n
 Tab Character: \t
 
 if __name__ == '__main__':
  Only run the code if the file is executed as a standalone file.
  
  Chapter 5- Loops:
  Loops are used to repeat an action a set number of times. (For, while).
  
  Range: The range(5, 10) will return the numbers from 5, up to, but not including ten.
  
  Range(5, 10, 2) Returns every second value between 5 and 10(9), is referred to as the 'step-value.'
  
  Dictionaries and For Loops: 
  a_dict = {'one':1, 'two':2}
  for key in a_dict:
    print(key)
    //Returns two, one, because dictionaries are unordered.
    
    The sort(keys) will sort the keys
    keys = sorted(a_dict.keys())
    
  Break: The break within functions is a FLOW CONTROL TOOL, terminates the current loop, and resumes executiion at the next statement.
  
  Continue: Skips over a specific loop.
  
  Chapter 6- Lists Comprehensions:
  
  [x for x in range(0, 10 ,2)]
  
  strip(): The strip() method removes leading/ending white space.
  
  Nested List Comprehension:
  nested_list = [ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] [7, 8, 9]]
  [num for elem in nested_list for num in elem]
  
  Dictionary Comprehensions:
  
  print( {i: str(i) for i in range(5)} )
