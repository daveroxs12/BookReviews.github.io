    def buildConnectionString(params): //Declare a function in Python
       1. Function doesn't specify a return datatype, nor is whether a value is returned specified.
       2. Every Python function returns a value. /
        A. If the function executes a return value, returns that value; else, the function will return a null value 'NONE' 
        
    Types: be
      Strongly-typed language: Language in which types are always enforced, such as, Python. For instance, if yoy haave an nteger, can't treat
      as a string, without explicitly converting it. 'Strong conversion.'
      
      Weakly-Typed Language: A language that disregards type, such as, VBSCcript. For instance, the string '12' can be concatenated with the 
      e to yield the string '123.' 'Weakly disregards type'
      
      Dynamically typed language: A language that discovers types at execution time, sych as, Python, which ascertains the variable type when 
      it is assigned. 'Dynamicslly = Discovers'
      
      Statically-Typed Language: A language in which types arre fixed at execution time, such as Java. All variables required to be 
      declared with type before execurion. 'Statically=Set'
      
      Docuemntation: By using a doc string """"Doing""" '''Hi'''
         MUST BE: First thing defined in a function, after the colon.       
         
      Import: Once a module is imported into Python, call it with module.function.
      
        __doc__ to request one of the module's attributes.
